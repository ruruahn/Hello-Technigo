<p>Just like in many other categories in life, to make a certain avenue accesible by as many people as possible is a crucial attitude to have as a creator. Websites is also a one of them. It is easy to look over the fact that a lot of people with various impairments can have difficulties in accessing the information you are providing from your websites. To be conscious of this issue and to try to fix this for many people as possible is the key point of accessibility.</p>

    2. People with mobility impairments <br> 
    Some people have troubles operating devices because of their mobility impairments. This for example includes people with paralysis in their body or having a hard time moving the mouse to click on things they want to see. In this case, one of the solution is to make the keyboard control easier as an alternative method.
